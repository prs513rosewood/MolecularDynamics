# Organizing Code in C++

C++ has very lax code organisation requirements which can be disorienting for
beginners. This note describes these requirements and the best practices for
code organisation.

## Compilation stages

Projects with multiple implementation files are compiled in two stages:

1. Creation of object files: each implementation file (`.cpp` or `.cc`) is
   compiled into an **object file**. Object files contain binary code that will
   be executed by the computer, as well as function call instructions. Each
   object file in the project is independently compiled.
2. Linking of object files: all object files are brought together into a single
   executable. At this point of the compilation the compiler checks that all the
   function calls in object files can be resolved.

These two stages of compilation make sense when thinking about avoiding
unecessary compilation if only a single function is changed: only the `.cpp`
file where the function is implemented will need to be recompiled.

It is very important to note that **each** `.cpp` file is **independently**
compiled, meaning the compiler does not know about functions defined in *other*
`.cpp` files. Giving that information to the compiler is the job of a **header**
file (`.hh` or `.h`). Header files typically *do not contain implementation
details*, they only give the **function signature**, or function definition.
Each function that is called in a `.cpp` file needs to have been declared, in
that file, either explicitely or in an included header file with `#include
"header.hh"`. If a function signature is missing the compiler will raise an
error.

In the second compilation stage (linking), the compiler needs to find *all the
function implementations* (and needs to find exactly one implementation per
fonction). If an object file is missing, the linker will raise an error about an
undefined symbol.


## Organizing Code

Knowing these requirements, one has a lot of freedom to organize code. For
example, all the function definitions could be in a single header file, with
each function implemented in a separate implementation file. However, the most
common way to structure code is to divide into *logical units*. Functions and
classes that logically belong together should be together in a single
implementation file and single header file. For example, the file `atoms.hh`
contains the class `Atoms`, and `atoms.cpp` contains the implementation of its
member functions. To use the `Atoms` class in a `.cpp` file, one needs then to
add `#include "atoms.hh"`.


### Example with manual compilation

To get a feel of how this works, let us consider a function `square` that
returns the square of a `double`. This function should be implemented in the
file `square.cpp`:

```cpp
// square.cpp

#include "square.hh"

double square(double x) {
    return x * x;
}
```

Next we need to provide the *function signature* in the header file `square.hh`:

```cpp
// square.hh
#ifndef SQUARE_HH
#define SQUARE_HH

double square(double x);

#endif
```

Note the use of an *include guard* (the couple `#ifndef/#define`), which
prevents the content of the file to be duplicated if it is included twice, which
causes compile errors. Finally, we use the function in `main()`:

```cpp
// main.cpp

#include "square.hh"

int main() {
    square(3);
    return 0;
}
```

To compile, we first generate the object files:

```
g++ -c square.cpp -o square.o
g++ -c main.cpp -o main.o
```

The `-c` flag indicates that we want to create an object file. Then we can link
an executable:

```
g++ main.o square.o -o square_example
```

Try removing `square.o` in the above command and see what error is raised. Try
removing `#include "square.hh"` and recompile `main.cpp` to see what error is
raised.

You can see the effect of the `#include` directive by passing `-E` to the
compiler, which only applies preprocessor directives like `#include`:

```
g++ -E main.cpp main.E
```

You'll see that the entire content of `square.hh` was duplicated into `main.E`.
The whole content of `main.E` is called a **translation unit**.

### Using CMake

CMake handles the two compilation stages transparently, so that the following
`CMakeLists.txt` should create the correct executable:

```cmake
project(compilation_example)

add_executable(square_example main.cpp square.cpp)
```

## Exceptions to the header/implementation rules

Two kinds of functions *must* be implemented in header files:

1. **Inline functions**: the `inline` keyword instructs the compiler to not
   create a function call but instead put the function implementation
   *in-place*. This is useful for performance reasons, but means the compiler
   must have access to the implementation, which must be in the header.
2. Functions with signatures that must be deduced by the compiler. This include
   function templates and functions with `auto` or `decltype(auto)` as a return
   type. The compiler needs the full knowledge of the function to deduce the
   information it is missing. Implementation must therefore be in the header.

Note that regular functions that would be normally implemented in `.cpp` files
can be implemented in header files *if and only if* they are marked as `inline`,
otherwise the compiler will create multiple symbols for the same function and
linking will fail.
